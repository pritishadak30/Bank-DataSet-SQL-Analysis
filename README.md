Perfect 👍 Thanks for sharing details. Since your GitHub project is a **SQL + CSV-based banking database system**, I’ll prepare a **README.md** that:

* Explains the project clearly,
* Lists the uploaded CSV tables,
* Highlights use cases (queries, insights),
* Avoids putting raw code/queries (as per your instruction).

Here’s a clean and professional draft:

# 🏦 MyBankDB – Banking Database Project

This project is a **relational database system** for a banking institution. It uses **7 CSV datasets** as input tables and demonstrates how SQL can be applied to manage, analyze, and derive insights from banking data.

---

## 📂 Datasets (CSV Tables)

The database is built using the following tables:

1. **Customer** → Stores customer information such as name, age, and unique ID.
2. **Accounts** → Contains account details like account type, balance, status, and opening date.
3. **Transactions** → Records customer transactions including amount, type, date, and description.
4. **Loans** → Manages loan details such as loan amount, interest rate, end date, and status.
5. **CreditCards** → Tracks issued credit cards, balances, and credit limits.
6. **Branches** → Holds information about different bank branches.
7. **ATMs** → Contains ATM details, locations, and operational status.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

* Simulate a **bank database** with real-world use cases.
* Perform **data exploration and management** using SQL queries.
* Generate **business insights** such as:

  * Total customers and active accounts
  * Loan and credit card statistics
  * Transaction analysis over time
  * Customer–account–loan relationships
  * ATM and branch activity monitoring

---

## 📊 Key Use Cases

* **Customer Analysis** → Age distribution, segmentation, and account ownership.
* **Account Insights** → Active vs inactive accounts, multiple accounts per customer.
* **Loan & Credit Tracking** → Highest loan amounts, overdue loans, credit limit usage.
* **Transaction Monitoring** → Identifying recent activity, monthly summaries, spending patterns.
* **ATM/Branch Operations** → Inactive ATMs by location, branch-wise activity.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB
* **Data Format:** CSV (imported into database)
* **Language:** SQL
* **Environment:** Localhost / MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin

---

## 📖 Workflow

1. Import CSV files into the database (`mybankdb`).
2. Establish relationships between tables (customers, accounts, transactions, etc.).
3. Run SQL operations for:

   * Data retrieval (SELECT queries)
   * Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
   * Joins for combining multiple tables
   * Filtering with conditions and date ranges
   * Data modifications (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
4. Derive actionable **banking insights**.

---

## ✅ Outcomes

* A **structured banking database** for simulation and learning.
* Practice with **SQL queries, joins, subqueries, case conditions, and aggregations**.
* Real-world banking scenarios modeled through datasets.
* Useful for **students, analysts, and beginners** learning SQL with finance-related data.
